            <h1> Just a simple document for you </h1>

            <p>Here is just a simple text about my day, today, to compose this amazing
            html page, that I'm doing just for the sake of it. 
            </p>
            <p>Well, today i woke up at <strong>5am</strong>, yeah, its was really early,
            but sadly its the time that I just wake up to work. Work was not that hard,
            just some people asking things, organizing my to do list (and doing it, of course),
            help my coworking friends and well, as everyone else, getting things done.
            </p>
            <p>It was almost <strong>12pm</strong> and I thought about what I was gonna eat for lunch.
                Its always hard to think about it, <em>really...</em>, but them, suddenly
                the amazing pasta came in my mind and them, I cook that. 
            </p>
            <p>Ok Ok, them after work I slept for like 1 hour and started my dancing workout.
                I was think about doing some strenght workout, but because of yesterday I was not
                feeling that well yet for another one. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                Well, probably this is starting to get a little bit boring so, just to put an end,
                I watched my programming class and now I'm typing this text, just for.. well, me?
                Yeah.
